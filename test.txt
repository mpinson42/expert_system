Data structures

Facts and rules storage

The students must have chosen a relevant data structure to handle their rules and facts. 

- A global graph of fact nodes linked by rule nodes is worth 5 
- A separate graph for each rule is worth 3 
- Anything else that is still more efficient than simple lists of facts and rules is worth 2 
- Lists of facts and rules are worth 1 
- Anything worse than that is worth 0 

Of course# the students must justify their choice. If they do not# their work is worth 0. 
Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)
Bonuses

Bonuses

Any distinct and identifiable bonus that the students can show and prove working is worth 1. 

Just in case# here are the bonuses that the subject suggests (Of course# it is still OK if they did something else# just make sure it is actually vaguely useful and not just a gimmick): 

- Interactive fact validation in case of undetermined facts or just to fiddle the input while running 
- Visualization of the reasoning process# either a GUI or a terminal interface# or even text# whatever# as long as it is comprehensible 
- "OR" and "XOR" in conclusions. This can lead to undetermined facts# and should also allow for negations in conclusions to be useful. 
- Biconditional rules ("If-and-only-if").
